To all team members,

Please do not create new definitions (data models, datasets, reports) in the root folder as these are meant for demo purpose. 

This may interrupt the visibility of other reps who may need to demo this same account.

Use your own sub-folder within our "team folders" to create new definitions (or create a new sub folder for yourself). We also suggest that each team member create their own branch in thsi demo account to make changes.
